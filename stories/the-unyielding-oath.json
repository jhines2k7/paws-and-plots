  "story": "<h3>Prologue</h3><p>In the realm of Eldrida, where the skies wept tears of sapphire and amethyst, the ancient oath of the Nine Realms was forged. It was a pact that bound the kingdoms of Eldrida, Valtoria, and Calonia in a sacred alliance, sworn to defend against the darkness that lurked beyond the borders of their lands.</p><h3>Chapter 1 - The Gathering Storm</h3><p>The day the skies grew dark was the day the prophecy unfolded. The once-peaceful realm of Eldrida was plagued by unrelenting storms, as if the very fabric of the skies was torn asunder. The people of Eldrida, Valtoria, and Calonia trembled with fear as the winds howled and the thunder boomed, foretelling the arrival of a calamity that would soon engulf their world.</p><h3>Chapter 2 - The Unyielding Oath</h3><p>In the heart of Eldrida's capital, the Grand Temple of the Ancients stood as a beacon of hope. It was here that the rulers of the Nine Realms gathered to reaffirm their sacred oath, pledging to stand united against the coming darkness. The oath was sworn, and the fate of the realms was sealed.</p>",
